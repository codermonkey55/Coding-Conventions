The phrase that will define all of the content to follow is this: 

#"Writing 'good code' is an art and you must learn and practice it."
  
Everyone may (very often do) have different definitions for the term ‘good code’. In my definition, the following are the characteristics of good code.

* Reliability (has an agreeable base-line)
* Maintainability (a bit more loaded, different requirements at each stage of the application-stack)
* Efficiency (very loaded, more applicable per use-case)

Most of the developers are inclined towards writing code for higher performance, compromising reliability and maintainability. But considering the long term ROI (Return On Investment), efficiency and performance comes below reliability and maintainability. If your code is not reliable and maintainable, you (and your company) will be spending lot of time to identify issues, trying to understand code etc throughout the life of your application. 

Another view to take on the concept of 'good code' is via a term I often use, "Exploratory Design/Development". Exploratory Design/Development in my experience is code that begins as an MVP (Note: mvp here can be anything from a simple method or feature to a whole suite of modules) and over multiple iterations (either via routine code reviews or feature requests, bug fixes) evolves into a final product that can either be frozen (per release basis or due to discontinuation) or enhanced/upgraded to a new version with extended api over the product life-cycle.

Open source projects in my personal opinion are paragon of this sort of approach to software development.
